    Home to about 500 species of plants and over 80 trees, the Semmozhi Poonga is a botanical garden that is ideal for family outings. It is like a green lung right in the centre of the daily din of the city. It was designed to house indigenous and foreign plants and spreads over an area of almost 20 acre.
